The new [Notessimo website](https://notessimo.net) has launched! Makes sure to check it out! This include a brand new [forum](https://community.notessimo.net) as well 

(don't worry, everything was transferred, nothing should've been lost but let me know if you can't find something!)

The [old website](https://archive.notessimo.net) is still available if you are feeling nostalgic

Still a lot of work to do but hopefully this should provide solid foundation moving forward. The website will be a huge and integral part of the next version of Notessimo. It will be accessible from within and be used to search for additional instruments to add to your composition.

Feel free to leave comments on the new [community website](https://community.notessimo.net) and if you have any ideas to improve the experience let me know!
