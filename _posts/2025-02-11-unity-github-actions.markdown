*(**TL;DR**: Build and publish your [Unity](https://unity.com/) app using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) via [GameCI](https://game.ci/))*

When you'll be done and setup, this project should be able to build your app for all the major platforms supported by Unity \**except consoles*\* (**Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **iOS**, **Android**, **WebGL**) (**mono** or **IL2CPP** for desktops). You'll have an automatic workflow to publish your app to the **macOS / iOS App Store**, **Google Play Store** and hosting on **S3**. No need to own a Mac or maintain an external web server!

This is very much opinionated, feel free to use as a starter-pack and modify as needed.

*(coming soon: Steam, itch.io, Windows Store and whatever is the flavor of the month for a Linux App Store)*

*(final part of my series on code-signing / distributing apps, check [Part 1 on Windows Code-Signing](/post/2025/01/29/code-signing.html))*

<br/>

## Introduction

[Unity Cloud Build](https://unity.com/solutions/ci-cd) doesn't do much, is pricey AND they also removed older versions of Unity from selection (just because...), so I needed a robust solution where I could simply click one button and have my build ready and published (and with self-hosted runner in a timely manner at 0 cost!).

Having a good CI/CD workflow setup is a must when doing cross-platform development, especially since manually submitting an app to the different App Stores is quite cumbersome and there is a risk for errors. Once setup, it's just works. And in a couple of years when there will be new requirement and your old app risk being removed from an app store, you'll be glad that you have reproducible builds and not waste days trying to figure out how to rebuild it and submit it.

Even as a solo developer, there's tons of benefits to it, you can simply start a build whenever without disrupting your computer and if you find a regression bug, quickly find at which point in time it was introduced by testing older builds and figuring the commits. 

Distributing on all major App Stores can be quite the headache, so I've break it down into separate steps.

Basically, once all the secrets are added to the repository, the workflows are able to properly sign and publish your app for the given platform.

<br/>

## Use the template

Start by creating a new repository using [this template](https://github.com/starburst997/unity-github-actions), it includes a sample "Hello World" Unity project in the folder `Unity.Test` which you can replace with your own. But I suggest you first starts by running the various actions using this simple project first to eliminate any issues that might be specific to your project.

<br/>

## Secrets / Variables

There's a bunch of secrets / variables we need to gather to have everything working, so buckle up. Skip any platforms / app stores you don't need. You need to set them in your repository settings in Github.

I suggests that you also add all of those secrets to a Password Manager. They can be re-used for your next projects, speeding up the process.

<br/>

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

We also need to generate a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for Github. This will enable us to create Github Release and increment the build number variables for each platforms. Need all **repo** access. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/starburst997/apple-code-sign?tab=readme-ov-file#generate-a-personal-access-token-pat).

#### Github Secrets

- `GH_PAT`: The value of your token

<br/>

### Unity

For the Unity's license activation we need to add a few more secrets. Follow [this guide](https://game.ci/docs/github/activation#setting-up-your-unity-license).

Locate your license file:
- Windows: `C:\ProgramData\Unity\Unity_lic.ulf`

<br/>

### Misc

Some miscellaneous secrets to personalize the workflows.

#### Misc Variables

- `APP_NAME_DISPLAY`: Name of your app for display (ex; `My Game`)
- `APP_COMPANY`: Company name for some metadata (ex; `Your Name`)
- `APP_UNITY_PATH`: Path to your Unity project (ex; `Unity.Test`)
- `APP_UNITY_VERSION`: The unity version (ex; `6000.0.35f1`)

<br/>

## Run the actions

Now that we have all the needed secrets and variables, we can call the workflow for each platforms individually to test each release. To do so, go to the **Actions** tab of your repository in Github, select a platform on the left panel and click **Run workflow**.

iOS / macOS requires that you run the **Apple Setup** workflow once to link it to the [match](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/) repository.

For Android, iOS and macOS you'll also want to create the App Page in their respective app store, make sure you followed the guide for each platform carefully.

The workflows reference the original files available in [another branch](https://github.com/starburst997/unity-github-actions/tree/v1/.github/workflows). This allow to provide update easily. But feel free to simply copy the originals instead and adapt.

<br/>

## Use self-hosted runners

*(optional)* While you can build all the platforms using Github's runners, to keep the bills low and speed up the build process, I strongly suggest that you setup your own [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).

Except for the workflows that require a specific platform to compile on (ex; macOS for iOS), they should all be cross-platforms.

Keep your repository private just to be safe if you use one!

Personally, I've setup a [Linux](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) VM (via [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/)) that auto-start on my Windows machine. This allow me to better control how much resources it can use so it doesn't disrupt my work (I never notice a build is compilling). 

Execute the [scripts/workflows/self-host.sh](https://github.com/starburst997/unity-github-actions/blob/main/scripts/workflows/self-host.sh) script to install missing softwares from a fresh `Ubuntu 24.04`. 

Apart from the jobs that requires a specific OS, a linux runner should be enough to ensure that the vast majority of the work is done locally so you save both time and money.

Simply set the `runner` and `runner-extra` variables in each workflows to use `self-hosted`.

### Use a local cache

*(optional)* By using the [Actions Cache Server](https://gha-cache-server.falcondev.io/) we can use a local cache for our self-hosted runners without any modifications to our workflows instead of going back and forth with Github's servers.

Create a yml file for docker (follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to setup docker).

#### docker-compose.yml
```yml
version: '3.9'

services:
  cache-server:
    image: ghcr.io/falcondev-oss/github-actions-cache-server:latest
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      URL_ACCESS_TOKEN: XXXXXXXX
      API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000
      CLEANUP_OLDER_THAN_DAYS: 30
    volumes:
      - cache-data:/app/.data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  cache-data:
```

And start the cache server: `docker compose up` (inside your VM)

Set this environment variable inside `~/actions-runner/.env`

```sh
ACTIONS_CACHE_URL=http://localhost:3000/XXXXXXXX/
```

Now we need to patch the DLLs of our Github Runner to use our `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` environment variable that will point to our cache server.

```sh
cp -n ~/actions-runner/bin/Runner.Worker.dll ~/Runner.Worker.backup.dll
sed -i 's/\x41\x00\x43\x00\x54\x00\x49\x00\x4F\x00\x4E\x00\x53\x00\x5F\x00\x43\x00\x41\x00\x43\x00\x48\x00\x45\x00\x5F\x00\x55\x00\x52\x00\x4C\x00/\x41\x00\x43\x00\x54\x00\x49\x00\x4F\x00\x4E\x00\x53\x00\x5F\x00\x43\x00\x41\x00\x43\x00\x48\x00\x45\x00\x5F\x00\x4F\x00\x52\x00\x4C\x00/g' ~/actions-runner/bin/Runner.Worker.dll
```

Don't worry, it simply replace the string `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` inside the DLL so our variable doesn't get overwritten.

*(they should really allow this option officially...)*

<br/>

## Use an organization

*(optional)* By using an organization instead of your personal account, you can setup all the secrets to be shared accross all the repositories (*only paid plans*), making it even faster to setup a new project. Bonus: you only need to setup one self-hosted runner as well since they are locked to one repository each otherwise.

You'll need to fork this template and replace all instances of `uses: starburst997/unity-github-actions` with `uses: <YOUR_ORG>>/unity-github-actions`. This is needed because referenced workflows needs to be from the same organization to inherit secrets. See [this diff](https://github.com/starburst997/unity-github-actions/compare/main...jd-boiv-in:unity-github-actions:main).

*(temporary until I fix this issue)* You'll also need to fork [this repository](https://github.com/starburst997/yearly-version) and replace all instances as well in your forked template repository in the `v1` branch to use this new fork instead. See [this diff](https://github.com/starburst997/unity-github-actions/compare/v1...jd-boiv-in:unity-github-actions:v1).

<br/>

## LFS

Enable LFS by renaming `.gitattributes.disabled` to `.gitattributes`.

<br/>

## Doing a release

The way I do my releases, I first create a build for a given platform by using **Run workflow** in **Actions** and set the **Release Candidate** option to `true`. I test it, fixes any issues and then move to the next platform. If an issue is platform specific, I fix it but I don't make another build for the other platforms I've already built and tested.

Once I'm satisfied, I run the **Release** action by selecting the **Use release candidates** option which will then look in **S3** for all the latest candidate builds for all the platforms and copy them to the release folder. The action will create a neat Discord notification, increment the release number and do a Github release.

The **Release** workflow will also output variables for each platforms that you can use to personalize your final release action (ex; ping your server).

For Google Play / Apple App Store, I manually select the build I vetted from the internal lanes. I don't do automatic release on stores.

1. Build the platform of your choice with Github Actions.

2. Discord notifications with links to download, play in your browser and commit diff.

3. [Github release](https://github.com/starburst997/unity-github-actions/releases) with binaries for all platforms.

4. Automatic publishing to Apple App Store and Google Play.

<br/>

## Conclusion

It took a bit more time than I expected but at least I have a workflow for building and publishing my unity apps that doesn't sucks, is *easy* to setup and that I can re-use from project to project.

I don't need to worry about certificates or read the same stack overflow answer years after years on how to generate some keys, I can simply set it up one time and be done (with automatic renewal).

The "building the unity app" step is pretty self-contained and could be adapted for any frameworks / engines, maybe [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) could be next...
