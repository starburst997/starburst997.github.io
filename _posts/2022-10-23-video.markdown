Being able to export to video was a much-requested feature for the longest time and it is finally available! Still a bit rough but functional!

Previously users would screen record the notessimo player

Besides the obvious watermark and low quality, it is also very hard to get a consistant perfect 60fps while screen recording which I think really helps improve the overall quality perception of the video.

Only `.avi` export is available currently but `.mp4` is coming very soon, I didn't want to just hastily bundled a 100MB+ `ffmpeg` build along the binary and the `.avi` format is extremely simple to support (with the downside of creating gigantic file but quality-wise, it is perfect).

Audio export is also available in `.wav`, `.mp3` and `.ogg`!

You can now see the difference with the new video exporter by comparing an [upload](https://notessimo.net/s/eBORKaihIJ) from one of the users, [Antonim](https://notessimo.net/u/Ace1257), the output is now a perfect 60fps with perfect audio sync and quality!
