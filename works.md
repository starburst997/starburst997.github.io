Not an exhaustive list, some projects I worked on got cancelled, others I can't talk about or there isn't really anything to show.

- [Notessimo](https://notessimo.net), a project dear to me, started out as a clone of [Mario Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Paint) but became much bigger over the years. Made with [Unity](https://unity.com/). Compose and share your music!

- Tetris prototype; a younger me with [Alexey Pajitnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov). I had the chance to work with him on some prototypes together with Francis Beausoleil (with whom I will cofound [FailSafe Games](https://failsafegames.com)). EA needed some help coming up with prototypes for a mobile version to present to him and we got approached after a Game Jam. Ours was very well received, with the best player of the world being flown over to play it!
