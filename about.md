Programmer since a little kid and currently having fun with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), hopefully I'll be able to get my hands on [Jai](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=JAI_(programming_language)&redirect=no) eventually!

I've been programming for pretty much two decades now, for fun and professionally. I absolutely love programming in my free time. Started back at the end of the last century with [Macromedia's Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and Web Development. I've been mostly working in the Video Games industry in Montreal since then with a slight detour doing mobile apps and electronics stuff (arduino / raspberry pi / 3D camera / VR) for festivals at an ad agency.

Versatile and entrepreneurial by nature, I thrive in anything tech-related, be it graphics or audio, backend or frontend, network or single-player gameplay, low-level or high-level, assembly or scripting, web or native app development, mobile or desktop, imperative or functional, gaming or B2B, I've done it all and I enjoyed them all as well (maybe a bit less in the case of web-dev :P).

I can take care of the whole app / game development process, something I've done numerous times at various companies. I have no problem jumping right in a new project (even if it's a tech I have never worked on previously, learning new stuff is particularly fun!). I love to overcome challenges; I am not looking for a cushy job (not that there's anything wrong with it!).

I speak french (born and raised in Quebec / Canada) and I am also fluent in English (most of my professional career has been in an english setting).

Don't hesitate to contact me for any freelance / consulting work you might have; I am always interested. Not looking for any permanent position at the moment.
